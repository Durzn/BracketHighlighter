- Fixed case where text that spans over exactly 2 lines wouldn't correctly be highlighted when searching forwards

## [1.0.5]
- Added option to blur out non-highlighted text (Thanks @VSCode Dimmer Block for the idea)
    -> can be enabled/disabled in the options, opacity value can also be configured
- Fixed case where text behind a closing bracket would wrongly be highlighted

## [1.0.4]

- Removed a check if the extension was activated

## [1.0.2]
- When using a background color, the highlighted text will now be shown on the left lane in the overview ruler
